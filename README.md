# Blog-Content-Writing-Templates
These are a collection of blog content templates in markdown one can use to quickly write, create, and format their articles.

The format of these articles are based off of popular and effective content structure formulas. 

Currently, you will need to copy and past these templates into the visual editor. 

If you do something awesome with these let me know!
