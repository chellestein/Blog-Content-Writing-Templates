# Blog-Content-Writing-Templates
These are a collection of blog templates one can use to quickly write, create, and format their articles in the WordPress editor based. The format of these articles are based off of popular and effective content structure formulas. Currently, you will need to copy and past these templates into the visual editor, though we will hopefully integrate with a plugin to streamline with WordPress soon.
